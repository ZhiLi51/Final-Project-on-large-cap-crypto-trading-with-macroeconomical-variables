Then there are other traditional approaches like Regression. Neural Networks have been popular in forecasting problems because of their ability to make predictions on non-linear complex data. Conventional statistical techniques don't work well with highly non-linear data. Multi-dimensional linear Regression has shown good results too on complex non-linear data (don't let the \"linear\" in it confuse you, it refers to the linear combination of input variables, the input variables themselves however can be expressed as higher degree polynomaials in the function that we are trying to model)\n",

This approach assumes that the future values can be expressed as a fuction of the past values. The two things to determine are - which past values to use (how far back into the past we need to look), and the parameters of the function itself\n",

    "Many times, we also include input variables that are of very different nature than the time-series under observation. For example, in Electrical load forecating the weather time series (temperature) is used as one of the input variables. It makes sense since in most regions of our planet, temperature does affect the electrical power consumption. A drop in the temperate regions would have people using more of their heaters, and in sub-tropical or tropical regions, a rise in temperatue typically drives the air-conditioning load.\n",

    "An input layer only has nodes. It's only job is take in the data and pass it on the hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dense layer has the links (edges) connected to it, with weights and everything. It also has an activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from each input node gets multiplied with the weights of the links via which those input nodes are connected to the first hidden layer. Each node of the hidden layer then combines all the inputs to it (one from each input node) and passes through an activation fuction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar process repeats for the second hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dropout layer is added before the output layer. It drops a certain percentage (20% in our case) of the links randomly, that are connected to the output node. It's a good practice and generally helps in curbing overfitting.\n",

    "The 15 new columns dataframe (df_new) will be passed through this network, one row at a time. The network will spit out an answer which will be compared with the value in the first column. This first prediction will be based on weights that mare set randomly. The error in the prediction will be used to change the weights in such a way that the prediction is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will happen for all the 1034 rows. We can adjust the weights after passing through multiple samples (rows) in what we call a \"batch\". When all the rows have passed in this way, we say one \"epoch\" is over. We go through many epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how many epochs do we have to go through, you ask? You already might have guessed. When we get the feel that out neural network model has captured the patterns in the data and is in a position to make predictions. How do we ensure that?\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do is hold out a few samples of data as a validation set. We don't use them for training (i.e for updating the weights). We only run the validation set after every epoch, and check the error. We also keep a track of the training error but it's not as important as validation error since the training error is what adjusts the weights. So, in a sense the training data is what the network soaks in. The validation data is something it doesn't soak in. As we keep checking the errors, only when the validation error has come down to near the training error, we stop further training.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to calcualte error. Here, we have used \"mean_squared_error\", and also used the \"adam\" optimizer algorith that is responsible for updating the weights (see \"model.compile\" part).\n",

The sliced dataframes having only the regressor input columns typically have a \"X\" in the names we assign them, and the sliced dataframes (or series) with only the actual values (also called target values, as in being \"targets\" for the neural netwroks to accurately predict while training) have a \"y\" in the names we assign them.\n",
